## Argument
*Explain why your contributions in relation to Polkadot are worthy of retention/promotion. Refer to the terms in Section 6 of the [Manifesto](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/main/manifesto.pdf) and provide links to relevant content (e.g. code, articles, media, etc.) to show that you are meeting all the requirements.*

Since 2024, I have been actively contributing to the Polkadot SDK. Below are my most relevant and impactful contributions:

Strengthened security around session key registration:
Requires an appropriate deposit to be paid when setting session keys; previously, only the Existential Deposit was needed.

➤ [#7953](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7953)

Handled silent failures in staking logic:
Fixed an oversight where calling nominate on a non-existent validator would silently succeed.

➤ [#8436](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8436)

Performance & Tooling Enhancements:
Migrated multiple pallets to the new Benchmarking V2 syntax:

➤ [#6564](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6564), [#6606](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6606), [#6607](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6607),  
  [#6612](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6612), [#6613](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6613), [#6614](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6614),  
  [#6615](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6615), [#6616](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6616), [#6617](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6617), [#6618](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6618)

Code Quality & Structural Refactoring:
Refactored and modularized oversized pallets to improve readability, maintainability, and long-term code health:

➤ [#6746](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6746), [#6779](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6779),  
  [#6780](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6780), [#6783](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6783)

Dependency & Architecture Upgrades
Migrated several pallets to the umbrella crate structure, addressing internal inconsistencies and aligning with best practices:

➤ [#6925](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6925), [#6930](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6930),  
  [#6931](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6931), [#7069](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7069), [#8285](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8285)
